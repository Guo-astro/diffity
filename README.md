### Comment on your diff

> Drag across line numbers or click the `+` in the gutter, write a comment, then hit **Send to Claude** to have it fix them.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/comment.gif" alt="Selecting lines in a diff and leaving a comment" />

### Let Claude fix your comments

> Hit **Send N to Claude**; it works through each comment, edits the code and replies in the thread, and you review its changes like any other diff.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/claude-fix.gif" alt="Sending two comments to Claude and its edits and replies landing on the diff" />

### Ask @claude

> Type `@claude` in any comment or reply and Claude answers in the same thread.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/claude-reply.gif" alt="Mentioning @claude in a comment and Claude replying in the thread" />

### Get a Claude review

> Click **Ask Claude to review**, optionally add what to focus on, and its comments land on the diff as it works.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/claude-review.gif" alt="Asking Claude to review and its comments appearing on the diff" />

### Review any commit or range

> Open the picker next to the project name to switch between uncommitted changes, a commit, a range or a branch.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/refs.gif" alt="Searching commits in the ref picker and opening one" />

### Review pull requests

> Pick a PR from the branch switcher to check it out, comment as you read, then **Submit review** to post it to GitHub.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/pull-request.gif" alt="Checking out a pull request from the branch switcher and opening the review panel" />

### Post reviews to GitHub

> Comment as you read, then **Submit review** as Comment, Approve or Request changes; GitHub comments sync back into the diff so you can reply or resolve from the app.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/post-review.gif" alt="Drafting a review comment on a pull request next to synced GitHub threads and approving it" />

### Browse and comment on any file

> Open the **Files** tab, pick any file in the repo and comment on its lines, even code the diff doesn't touch.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/files.gif" alt="Opening a file from the Files tab and commenting on two of its lines" />

### Jump anywhere

> Press `⌘P` to open any file, or `⌘K` to search commits, comments, PRs and every action.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/palette.gif" alt="Opening a file with ⌘P and switching to dark theme with ⌘K" />

### Switch projects

> Open a repo with `⌘O`; it stays in the left rail, so `⌘1`–`⌘9` takes you back to it.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/projects.gif" alt="Switching between projects in the rail" />

### Open from the terminal or your agent

> Run `diffity` in any repository to open it in the app, or pass a pull request URL to review it.

Install the command once from the app menu: **Diffity → Install ‘diffity’ Command…**. It links the command into `/usr/local/bin` and asks for your password if that folder needs it.

<img src="./.github/screenshots/install-command.png" width="320" alt="The Diffity menu with Install ‘diffity’ Command…" />

```sh
diffity                                        # uncommitted changes in the current repository
diffity ~/code/app                             # another repository
diffity --ref main                             # everything on this branch since it left main
diffity --ref HEAD~1..HEAD                     # the last commit
diffity https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42  # check out and review a pull request
diffity src/app.ts                             # a file in the Files tab
diffity -n                                     # in a new window
```

`--ref` takes anything the ref picker does: `work`, `staged`, `unstaged`, a branch or commit, `<a>..<b>` or `<a>...<b>`. A pull request opens in the current repository if it is a clone of that repo, else in a clone Diffity already knows; with neither, Diffity offers to clone it. Run `diffity --help` for everything.

Coding agents can run it too, so you can ask Claude Code to “open your changes in Diffity” before it opens a PR.

### More

- **Find in the whole diff.** `⌘F` searches every file in the diff, including collapsed ones, and `⌘G` jumps to the next match.
- **Changed since you viewed it.** Files you marked Viewed get a badge when they change again, and one click shows just what changed.
- **Hide generated files.** Add a `.diffityignore` to your repo (same syntax as `.gitignore`), or a list in Settings, and those files stay out of your diffs:

  ```gitignore
  dist/
  *.generated.ts
  !dist/keep-me.js
  ```
- **Colour-blind friendly colours.** Settings → General → Appearance switches the diff to blue and orange, in light and dark.
- **Split or unified, light or dark.** Toggle the diff layout anytime; the theme follows your Mac unless you pick one in Settings.
- **Updates itself.** New versions install in place, and What's New in the Help menu shows what changed.
